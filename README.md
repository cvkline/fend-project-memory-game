## What is this project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I'm converting this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Contributing

This is a project I'm working on for a Udacity course, so I won't be accepting pull requests
